CWL Java SDK
============

This is a work-in-progress implementation for creating a Java SDK for CWL.
Please read the "CWL Java SDK Manual.PDF" for how to generate the SDK.

If you want to test it out quickly, just download this repository and run
the following command:

./compile-and-run.sh

All comments and recommendations are welcome.

Thank you,
Paul
